# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Transforming static GIF gallery into comprehensive League of Legends match details application.

## Recent Changes

- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Established project requirements and technical approach
- Planned component-based architecture

## Next Steps

1. Implement core HTML structure with routing system
2. Build API service layer for Riot API integration
3. Create essential UI components
4. Implement tabbed interface for data organization
5. Add responsive styling and League theme
6. Create search interface and error handling
7. Add data visualizations and charts

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### API Integration Approach

**Decision Made**: Pure frontend solution with direct API calls to Riot endpoints.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Direct API calls with CORS proxy for development
- Proper error handling for CORS-related issues
- Client-side API key handling (with security considerations)
- Fallback strategies for API limitations

### Routing Strategy

**Decided**: Client-side routing with format `/{region}{matchId}`

- Extract region code (EUW1, NA1, KR, etc.)
- Extract match ID from remaining characters
- Validate both before API calls

### Component Architecture

**Decided**: Vanilla JavaScript with modular components

- No framework dependencies
- ES6 modules for organization
- Event-driven communication

### Styling Approach

**Decided**: Maintain existing League theme

- Purple/gold color scheme (#1a1c4b, #2a1758, #c7a45d)
- Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Current Challenges

1. **API CORS**: Need clarification on backend setup
2. **Data Complexity**: Organizing extensive match statistics
3. **Performance**: Minimizing API calls while maintaining responsiveness
4. **Mobile UX**: Presenting dense data on small screens

## Implementation Priority

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Routing and API service
2. **Essential Components**: Match display and navigation
3. **Data Views**: Tabbed interface for statistics
4. **Polish**: Responsive design and error handling
5. **Advanced Features**: Charts and visualizations

## Questions for User

- Is there an existing backend API proxy for Riot API calls?
- Are there specific statistics or data views that are most important?
- Should the home page include match search functionality?
- Any specific design preferences beyond the current theme?
